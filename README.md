# tezos-saving

Based on Taquito Boilerplate in React ![Reference][ref]

## About

This project would like to help users to form good saving habit by rewarding them with extra Tezos if they are able to deposit some Tezos for some periods on time.
Their Tezos will be locked and the participants will be able to withdraw their money plus the rewards.
If the participants choose to withdraw early then they have to pay 30% fee. This fee will be shared among other participants who are able to follow through the saving process.

In addition, this can promote people to buy and save Tezos which is good for the ecosystem.

Future work:
1. Create a factory contract to create savings contracts. People can create a saving contract with different kinds of parameters (i.e. how long, what the required deposit is, etc).
2. Update frontend to show all of the created saving contracts.
3. Improve UI.
